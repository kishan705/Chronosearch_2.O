No, having **1 or 2 bot accounts** sitting in your database is **not dangerous** to your server's health. They are just rows of text in a SQLite file. They won't explode your computer.

However, allowing **manual registration without protection** is dangerous because 1 or 2 bots quickly become **1 or 2 million**.

Here is the breakdown of the real risks:

### 1. Is a "Fake ID" dangerous?

If a bot registers `bot_01` and does nothing, it is harmless.
The danger comes from **what they do next**:

* **Upload Spam:** They upload 100 illegal or spam videos. If your cloud provider (Modal/AWS) sees illegal content, **they will ban your account**.
* **Link Spam:** They post comments with links to scam sites. This ruins your reputation.
* **Cost:** If they upload huge videos, **you pay** for the storage and processing.

### 2. Why "No Gmail" (Manual Auth) is vulnerable

A "username/password" form is just an open door.

* **Humans** take 1 minute to fill it out.
* **Scripts** take 0.01 seconds.
* A hacker writes a loop: `for i in range(10000): register_user()`.
* Suddenly, your database is full, your disk is full, and your server crashes.

### 3. The Professional Solution (What Big Companies Do)

You **must** keep manual registration (for users who don't want Google), but you **must** lock the door.

**The "Defense Shield" for Manual Registration:**

1. **Rate Limiting (Layer 1):** "One account per IP every 10 mins." (We can add this easily).
2. **CAPTCHA (Layer 2):** "Click the traffic lights." (This stops 99.9% of scripts).
3. **Email Verification (Layer 3):** "Click the link sent to your email." (Bots usually don't have access to real inboxes).

### 💡 My Advice for You

Since you are a single developer with 8 days:

1. **Implement Google Login:** This is your "Safe Zone."
2. **Keep Manual Login:** But add **Rate Limiting** (Layer 1).
3. **Don't worry about 1-2 bots now:** You can manually delete them from the database if they appear.

**Do you want to proceed with getting the Google Client ID now?** It is the biggest security upgrade you can make today.
